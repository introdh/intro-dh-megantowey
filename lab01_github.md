Markdown is a way to write content for the web. 
Plain markdown is just a very simple format for marking up
texts. Unlike write text in a word editor, there is nothing
hidden in a markdown file. If you want something to be in
italics, surround it in single stars like *this*. For bold,
use **two**.

Complete the following items using Markdown using [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

The biggest questions I have going into this class are:
1. What are some terms which I need to become familiar with?
2. How can having DH skills help with research in classics?
