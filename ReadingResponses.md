### 2017-10-23: Spatial history

Evgenia Shnayder, *A Data Model for Spatial History*

> One of the most important aspects of the geodatabase is its flexibility in adding new data... Because no researcher can predict what kinds of data will be needed or discovered as the project progresses, a geodatabase must be able to absorb new information and connect it to existing sources seamlessly in order to allow for new analyses.

The potentiality of the project to encompass new types of data seems like it needs more specific definition. Of course this is crucial conceptually, but how do we know which types of data are incongruent, or account for types of data that maybe haven't come into existence yet?

> In building a "core" nineteenth-century Western Railroads Geodatabase, we have taken the first step towards producing a new collaborative spatial history analysis, one that is constantly evolving with each added layer of archival information.

Layering planes of data upon each other is a way for me to visualize the exchange of information used by the database.


David J. Bodenhamer, *Beyond GIS: Geospatial Technologies and the Future of History*

> At its core, the spatial turn rejects the universal truths, grand narratives, and structural explanations that dominated the social sciences and the humanities during much of last century. Above all, it is about the particular and the local, without any supposition that one form of culture is better than another. Its claim is straightforward: To understand human society and culture, we must understand how it developed in certain circumstances and in certain times and at certain places.

The field of classical studies has suffered greatly under the influence of false "grand narratives," to the point that the field's existence at all becomes inextricable from well-rejected "hierarchy" of cultures. I am curious about how geospatial technology in particular can contribute to denying poisonous tropes about the classical world.

> Better suited to the humanities is the related field of geovisualization, ranging from dynamic maps to virtual reality and cybergeography.

The Digital Roman Forun Project is excellent; this is the future I signed up for!! On a side note, NASA has made publically available a version of their VR Mars Rover simulator. It will eventually be used to train astronauts!



 

### 2017-09-18: Distant reading

Matthew Jockers, *Macroanalysis: Digital Methods and Literary History*

> The underlying assumption is that by exploring the literary record writ large, we will better understand the context in which individual texts exist and thereby better understand those individual texts. 

Here is one instance where I am grateful for Jockers' clarification. The etymological connection between 'text' and 'context' suggests that they are in a much more simplistic relationship than is commonly discovered.

> Literary criticism relies heavily on associations as evidence. Even though the notions of evidence are different, it is reasonable to insist that some associations are better than others.

My impression of associative thinking is that it is open-ended, entirely, and serves as its own evidence - not shaped by the needs of criticism, literary or otherwise, and this is kind of the whole point.

Kathryn Schulz, 'What is Distant Reading?'

> As the literary ars lurches exponentially more longa — accommodating the printing press, “Gravity’s Rainbow,” Google Books — our collective TBR pile towers ever more vertiginously overhead. 

Even knowing this printed in the Sunday Book Review, and that assumes an audience of advanced and dedicated readers, I can't understand why the author thought 'vertiginously' is a word that should appear in the first graf, why "Gravity's Rainbow" gets singled out (yes, it's a long book, but "Infinite Jest" is much more recognizable as an unweighty text, right?), or why "TBR" is thrown in like casual lingo? Ok, but I am close reading.

> For example, Moretti, quoting a colleague, defines “protagonist” as “the character that minimized the sum of the distances to all other vertices.” Huh? O.K., he means the protagonist is the character with the smallest average degree of separation from the others, “the center of the network.” So guess who’s the protagonist of Hamlet? Right: Hamlet. Duh.

This 'Aha' moment neatly encapsulates the tone and argument of Schulz's article.
