### 2017-09-18: Distant reading

Matthew Jockers, *Macroanalysis: Digital Methods and Literary History*

> The underlying assumption is that by exploring the literary record writ large, we will better understand the context in which individual texts exist and thereby better understand those individual texts. 

Here is one instance where I am grateful for Jockers' clarification. The etymological connection between 'text' and 'context' suggests that they are in a much more simplistic relationship than is commonly discovered.

> Literary criticism relies heavily on associations as evidence. Even though the notions of evidence are different, it is reasonable to insist that some associations are better than others.

My impression of associative thinking is that it is open-ended, entirely, and serves as its own evidence - not shaped by the needs of criticism, literary or otherwise, and this is kind of the whole point.

Kathryn Schulz, 'What is Distant Reading?'

> As the literary ars lurches exponentially more longa — accommodating the printing press, “Gravity’s Rainbow,” Google Books — our collective TBR pile towers ever more vertiginously overhead. 

Even knowing this printed in the Sunday Book Review, and that assumes an audience of advanced and dedicated readers, I can't understand why the author thought 'vertiginously' is a word that should appear in the first graf, why "Gravity's Rainbow" gets singled out (yes, it's a long book, but "Infinite Jest" is much more recognizable as an unweighty text, right?), or why "TBR" is thrown in like casual lingo? Ok, but I am close reading.

> For example, Moretti, quoting a colleague, defines “protagonist” as “the character that minimized the sum of the distances to all other vertices.” Huh? O.K., he means the protagonist is the character with the smallest average degree of separation from the others, “the center of the network.” So guess who’s the protagonist of Hamlet? Right: Hamlet. Duh.

This 'Aha' moment neatly encapsulates the tone and argument of Schulz's article.
